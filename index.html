      5 years after defeating the Nazi encryption device known as “Enigma”, mathematician Alan Turing asked a historical question: can machines think? This is widely regarded as the starting point of what we now know as Artificial Intelligence. In essence, artificial intelligence is a form of computer science that tries to simulate or replicate human intelligence, logic, and behavior.

  Since the 1950’s, artificial intelligence has improved by bounds and leaps. This has allowed us to improve several aspects of society including increasing efficiency, assisting those with disabilities, and optimization of computing.

However, with this improvement in efficiency and computing, there comes negatives such as coded bias within the artificial intelligence that can seep into society and negatively affect some people's everyday lives.
