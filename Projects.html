    <p class="leftParagraph">
      Connect-4 with a twist! This was coded using Java Object Oriented Programming. Specifically, with JPanel and
      JFrame.
      <br><br>
      In this game, you can play against another player or against a computer program. The twist is that there are
      powerups! The blue tile puts a piece of your colour in the adjacent columns and the green tile skips the
      opponent's next turn.
